# CPU Scheduling Simulator 
# CS540 Operating Systems - Thanh Dang

## This project using `React.js` to build a single-page application (SPA) that simulates some CPU scheduling algorithms. Besides, other supporting libraries are needed to complete all required functionalities of the project, such as `chart.js`, `jspdf`, `gh-pages`, etc.

## Algorithms
- FIFO (First In First Out)

- SJF (Shortest Job First)

- STCF (Shortest Time-to-Completion First)

- RR (Round Robin)

- MLFQ (Multi-Level Feedback Queue)

## Features
- Each algorithm should be implemented as a separate function.
- the user should be able to set the number of processes and the time quantum (for RR).
- the user should be able to run each algorithm and see the results.
- the user should be able to run all algorithms and see the results side by side.
- use animation to show the progress of each algorithm.
- use `chart.js` to show the results as a bar chart.
- save/download the results as a PDF file.
